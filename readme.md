# Vacation Planner Assistant

This project is an AI-driven **vacation planner assistant** that engages users in dynamic conversations to provide **real-time hotel recommendations**. Built using Google's Generative AI and integrated with **SerpAPI**, it seamlessly combines AI capabilities with live data to simplify vacation planning.

## Features

- **Real-Time Hotel Search**: Fetch live hotel recommendations tailored to the user's preferences (e.g., location, dates, price range, amenities).
- **Intelligent Conversations**: The assistant uses Google's `gemini` model to maintain a natural and interactive conversation flow.
- **Tool Integration**: AI seamlessly triggers real-time hotel queries using **SerpAPI**.
- **Timezone Awareness**: Handles timezone differences explicitly to ensure accurate date handling for bookings.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear feedback in case of invalid inputs or unexpected issues.
- **Interactive Console**: Users can engage directly via a clean and conversational command-line interface.

   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Add the following keys:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
     SERP_API_KEY="your_serpapi_key"
     ```

### 3. Running the Project

To start the assistant, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Interacting with the Assistant

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The assistant engages the user for details like destination, check-in/out dates, price range, etc.
2. **Hotel Search Trigger**: The assistant identifies hotel-related queries and fetches data via **SerpAPI**.
3. **Live Results**: Processed hotel data is displayed with ratings, price estimates, and direct booking links.
4. **Dynamic Follow-ups**: AI ensures the conversation flows naturally while accommodating user preferences.

## Example Interaction

**User**: *Find hotels in Los Angeles for December 16-20 under $300.*  
**Assistant**:
```
